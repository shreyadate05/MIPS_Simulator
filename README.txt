Command to run:
python main.py <path_of_instructions> <path_of_data> <path_of_config> <path_of_result>

example: 
main.py .\test_cases\example\inst.txt .\test_cases\example\data.txt .\test_cases\example\conf.txt .\test_cases\example\ans.txt



In case all the test cases do not work, I humbly request you to consider the following things while grading my project.
1. Implemented Without-Memory
2. Implemented Branching - handled loop iterations
3. Implemented I-Cache
4. Implemented D-Cache (in progress)

5. Highly Modular and clean code
6. Added Logging
7. Error handling done
8. Overall data structures used and design of the code

Please please consider the above!!
Thank you!
